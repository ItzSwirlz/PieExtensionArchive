# PieExtensionArchive
Archiving the Pie Adblock and Pie Shopping website extensions (believed to be also owned by PayPal)

(See the Honey Extension Archive repository)

# Why?
PayPal might also own the Pie AdBlock (which is suspicious in itself - get money by watching ads) and Pie Shopping which is basically the same thing as Honey.

So, just in case, I'm archiving these here.

Thankfully Pie Shopping was last updated December 9, 2024 - before MegaLag's video. Pie Adblock was not - it was last updated December 30, 2024. Hopefully someone has an archived older version.
